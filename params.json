{"name":"Gitim","tagline":"Generalized Identification of Truly Interfacial Molecules","body":"### Status\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Marcello-Sega/gitim.svg?branch=ITIM)](https://travis-ci.org/Marcello-Sega/gitim)\r\n\r\n## What is ITIM/GITIM?\r\n\r\n**ITIM** and **GITIM** are two algorithms for the identification\r\nof interfacial molecules or atoms. GITIM is a generalization of the\r\nITIM algorithm, which was designed for planar interfaces. GITIM,\r\non the contrary, is free from any geometrical constraints and can\r\nbe used to analyze intrinsic properties of surfaces with arbitrary\r\nshape. \r\n\r\n## What can I find here ? \r\n\r\nThere are two branches, ITIM and GITIM, which implement the respective\r\nalgorithms in the form of a program that can read\r\n[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org) trajectories.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Which branch should I use, ITIM or GITIM? \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in planar interfaces only, use the ITIM branch.\r\n\r\nCurrently the code is undergoing a major restructuring, with new\r\nfeatures added and bugs fixed. The ITIM branch is so far the most\r\nup-to-date, with a new build system that ensures compatibility with\r\na broader range of GROMACS versions. New features/bugfix are being\r\nbackported to the GITIM branch.\r\n\r\n## Which features are included? \r\n\r\n\r\n* Identification of interfacial atoms\r\n* Identification of interfacial molecules\r\n* Identification of further atomic/molecular layers\r\n* Cluster search to deal with partially miscible systems\r\n* Calculation of intrinsic and non-intrinsic density and mass profiles\r\n* Use of enhanced Monte Carlo sampling to take into account the fluctuations of the opposite interface on the density profiles\r\n* Exporting PDB files containing also the information on the layer to which atoms belong to, as well as the intrinsic distance from the surface.\r\n\r\n_Note: Some of the features are so far present only in the ITIM branch and are currently being ported to the GITIM branch._\r\n\r\n\r\n## Which code is faster, ITIM or GITIM\r\n\r\nITIM, by far. This is because GITIM needs to compute the alpha-shape\r\nof the phase, which in turn relies on the Delauney triangulation.\r\nThis is done through QHull, but it is still much slower than the\r\nITIM algorithm.  So, if you only have to deal with planar interfaces,\r\ngo for the ITIM branch.\r\n\r\n## What do I need to build the code ? \r\n\r\n* A gromacs build + sources (compatibility starting from GROMACS 4.6.7 up to 5.1) \r\n* Cmake >= 2.8.11\r\n\r\n## What can you do with GITIM?\r\n\r\nCheck out the [usage example page](http://www.gitim.eu/usage-examples) of the gitim web site http://www.gitim.eu\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nIf you use this code to publish some research results, please read and cite both of the two following papers.\r\n\r\n[M.
