{"name":"Gitim","tagline":"Generalized Identification of Truly Interfacial Molecules","body":"## What is GITIM?\r\n\r\n**GITIM** is an algorithm to identify interfacial molecules or atoms. It is a generalization of the ITIM algorithm, which was designed for planar interfaces. GITIM, on the contrary, is free from any geometrical constraints and can be used to analyze intrinsic properties of surfaces with arbitrary shape. The present implementation is written in the form of a GROMACS tool. Besides the possibility to identify interfacial molecules, the GITIM implementation allows you to compute intrinsic density profiles and intrinsic profiles of the orientational order parameters.\r\n\r\n## What can you do with GITIM?\r\n\r\nCheck out the usage example page of the gitim web site http://www.gitim.eu\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nIf you use this code to publish some research results, please read and cite the two following papers.\r\n\r\nGITIM: M.
