The gitim program is derived from the g_density tool of the original
gromacs source (http://www.gromacs.org). This is free software (see
the licence in the COPYING file) and comes with no warranty.  The
code makes use, in addition, of (a) a slightly modified version of
the kdtree (http://code.google.com/p/kdtree/) routines, which are
included directly in the sources of this project, along with the
copyright notice (also in the COPYING-KDTREE.txt file) and (b) a
slightly modified version of the qhull software (http://www.qhull.org/
version 2010.1) in form of a library, for the calculation of alpha
shapes (copyright notice in COYING-QHULL.txt). The modifications
on the qhull code were done by M.S. (below) to provide interoperability
between the gromacs-derived code and qhull.

Additional information can be found in the HOWTO file, on the project 
website

Neither the gromacs, kdtree and qhull developers nor any other

support and do not submit bug reports to the gromacs, kdtree or
qhull website, but contact us instead.
